# ðŸ““My Daily PlannerðŸ““
A daily planner web application that contains a to do section.

## About this Project
This web application was made with JS, HTML5, CSS, React, Ruby, and Sinatra. The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API. Another focus was making a One-To-Many relationship model.

## FAQ 

Q: Why is it called a planner if the only thing available is the todo?

A: More is coming your way. I hope to implement this web app on my free time. Updates coming soon.
